# SIGMORPHON 2022 Shared Task on Morpheme Segmentation

Morphemes (prefixes, suffixes, root words) are linguistic descriptions, defined as the smallest meaningful unit of words. Our proposed shared task is morpheme
segmentation that converts a text into a sequence of morphemes. In order to prepare a dataset for this task, we integrated all basic types of morphological
databases (including [UniMorph](https://github.com/unimorph) (Kirov et al., 2018b; McCarthy et al., 2020) – inflectional morphology; [MorphyNet](https://github.com/kbatsuren/MorphyNet) (Batsuren et al., 2021) – derivational morphology; Universal Dependencies (Nivre et al., 2017) and ten editions of Wiktionary – compound morphology and root words). In the future, we expect the NLP community will
benefit a lot by innovating subword-based tokenization with this task. This shared task has two parts:

+ ***Part 1***: [Word-level morpheme segmentation](https://github.com/sigmorphon/2022SegmentationST#)
+ ***Part 2***: [Sentence-level morpheme segmentation](https://github.com/sigmorphon/2022SegmentationST#)

Two subtasks will be scored separately. Participant teams may submit as many systems as they want to as many subtasks as they want.

## Part 1: Word-level Morpheme Segmentation
At the word level, participants will be asked to segment a given word into a sequence of morphemes. Input words contains all types of word forms: root words, derived words, inflected words, and compound words.

### Data
Training and development data are UTF-8-encoded tab-separated values files. Each example occupies a single line and consists of input word, the corresponding morpheme sequence, and the corresponding morphological category. The following shows three lines of English data:
    
    inaccuracies  in @@accurate @@cy @@s  110
    dictionary  dictionary  000
    screwdriver screw @@drive @@er  011

<i> Note: The third column as the morphological category is an optional feature that can only be used to oversample or undersample training data.</i>

First example is a derived word with prefix (in-) and suffixes (-cy and -s), and second example is a root word. Third example is a compound word. In the test datasets, we will provide only first column of data as input words. 

### Languages
Development languages are:
1.  `ces`: Czech
2.  `eng`: English
3.  `fra`: French
4.  `hun`: Hungarian
5.  `spa`: Spanish
6.  `ita`: Italian
7.  `lat`: Latin
8.  `rus`: Russian

Surprise language is:

9. `mon`: Mongolian

### Word category description
For some of the development languages, we are providing the word categories so that participant can deal with imbalanced situation of morphological categories.

### Baseline results

The following table shows the word-level task results of pretrained `BertTokenizer` on English. This pretrained model was employed from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/tokenizer#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer). 

| word class | inflection | derivation | compound |   R   |   P   |   F1  | lev. distance |

## Part 2: Sentence-level Morpheme Segmentation
At the sentence level, participating systems are expected to predict a sequence of morphemes for a given sentence.
The following shows two lines of English data:

    Six weeks of basic training . Six week @@s of base @@ic train @@ing .
    Fistfights , please . Fist @@fight @@s , please .

The following shows two lines of Mongolian data:

    Гэрт эмээ хоол хийв . Гэр @@т эмээ хоол хийх @@в .
    Би өдөр эмээ уусан . Би өдөр эм @@ээ уух @@сан .

In above example, `эмээ` is a hononym of two different words, first means a `grandmother` and second is `medicine`. Depending on the context, the second homonym word is inflectional form of `medicine` and it is segmentable.

### Languages
Development languages are:
1.  `ces`: Czech
2.  `eng`: English
3.  `mon`: Mongolian

## Evaluation

We will provide python evaluation scripts, reporting the following evaluation measures:

- Precision - fraction of correctly predicted morphemes on all predicted morphemes
- Recall - ratio of correctly predicted morphemes on all gold morphemes 
- F-measure - the harmonic mean of the precision and recall
- Edit distance - average Levenshtein distance between the predicted output and the gold instance.

## Submission

Please submit your team's results to khuyagbaatar.b@gmail.com CCing your teammates by May 13th, 2022 (AoE). Each submission should be a .tar.gz or .zip file.
